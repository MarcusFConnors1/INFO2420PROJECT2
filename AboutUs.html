<h2 id="began">How It All Began...</h2>

<p>
In 1997, Master Chef Pierre DeBois moved to Utah from New York where he owned
and managed a small restaurant called Ma Maison (My Home). His restaurant
specialized in French Nouvelle cuisine.
</p>

<p>
Once in Salt Lake City, he realized that the average Utahan doesn't have much
appreciation for high cuisine. Pierre and his family were invited to a
neighborhood block party one summer and it was there he had his first
encounter with Native Cooking of Utah.
</p>

<p>
Pierre noticed how much the locals enjoyed the items brought to this pot luck
dinner. They often went back for seconds or thirds. How could he capture this
enthusiasm for eating and translate it into his own cooking?
</p>

<p>
In order to answer this question, he began a year long quest to find out the
reason for the success of Utah cuisine.
</p>

<p>
Pierre discovered there are some things that set Utah cooking apart from others:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simplicity in preparation</li>
  <li>Inexpensive ingredients</li>
  <li>Ethnic variations available</li>
  <li>Feeds large amounts of people</li>
  <li>Ease of serving and cleanup</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="online">Native Cooking of Utah Goes Online...</h2>

<p>
In 2010, Pierre DeBois began gathering recipes for an online cookbook titled
Native Cooking of Utah. Everywhere he could, he begged, borrowed, or stole
the secret recipes of popular Utah cooks.
</p>

<p>
Many of these recipes had been handed down from generation to generation.
In fact, the most well known recipe for green jello was even honored with
its own Olympic pin.
</p>

<p>
The web site for Native Cooking of Utah organizes the recipes by area of the
state. For example, salt water taffy from Salt Lake City and Bear Lake
raspberry ice cream from Bear Lake.
</p>

<p>
Chef Pierre DeBois has traveled the state to gather these recipes. Read the
Guestbook to see comments and testimonials from satisfied cooks.

<h2 id="future">Looking to the Future...</h2>

<p>
Native Cooking of Utah has become one of the most popular cooking sites in
the Western United States with over 10,000 hits per week.
</p>

<p>
Chef Pierre DeBois plans to expand the site to include cooking utensils and
kitchen accessories used or hand-made by native Utahans.
</p>
